The first hurdle to most would-be Flutter developers is being convinced to
learn a new, sparsely used Language: Dart.

If you're coming from a C-like syntax language like Java, it'll be very easy
to learn. If you're coming from JavaScrtipt, there are some important differences.

I imagine a lot of Flutter developers are going to be coming from the world of
JavaScript, so I'll point out the major differences between JS and Dart here.

Syntactically, you're in good shape if you've ever used TypeScript or Java. In fact, for JS web developers, the biggest road block to overcome is going be using a typed language. You'll also potentially have to get used to Object Oriented Programming, as JavaScript uses a prototypical hierarchy that's fairly unique.

  print('Logging to the console: ... ');
}
// -> Logging to the console: ...
```
